- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @soschuetze
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data science, specifically machine learning and natural language processing. 
     As a data science and economics major at Wellesley College, I am interested in how these two fields intersect to help businesses thrive and flourish.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Twitter's relationship with the BLM movement in preparation for my thesis project that explores the different modes
     of protest during the BLM movement and how tweets refelct those.
