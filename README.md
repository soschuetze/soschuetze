- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @soschuetze
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data science, specifically regarding the intersection of econometric data analysis and public policy. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Twitter's relationship with the BLM movement in preparation for my thesis project that explores the different modes
     of protest during the BLM movement and how tweets refelct those.
